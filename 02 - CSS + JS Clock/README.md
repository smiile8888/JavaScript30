# Day 2: CSS + JS Clock
Today, the practice is about creating a clock by using CSS for animation and JS for collecting and updating data behind the scence.

Today I'm getting to know:
In CSS:
- `transform` - uses to rotate/transform the elements, in this case are the clock's hands.
- `transform-origin` - allows to change the position of transformed elements.

In JS:
- `Date()` - gets the current date time, which allows to get details in hours, minutes and seconds.
