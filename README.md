# JavaScript30
My everyday practice from JavaScript 30 days with Wes Bos.
Here, I follow the starting source codes, but I put some more of mine.
Mainly, it focuses on how to use JS with HTMl and CSS in many cases, including (real-time) effects, web-based gaming.

If anyone is interested in, please see more on [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/)
