# JavaScript30
My everyday practice from JavaScript 30 days with Wes Bos.

Mainly, it focuses on how to use JS with HTMl and CSS in many cases, including (real-time) effects, web-based gaming.

Here, I follow the starting source codes, but I put some more of mine.

I seperate in each type of file - .html, .css, .js.

Each day, I summarize what the practice is about, including what I have learned from.
