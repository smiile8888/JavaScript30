# Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit
Today practice is about creating the interactive drum, receiving the events via keyboard.

Today I'm getting to know:
In HTML:
- `data-*` attribute - allows to create own attributes
- `<kbd></kbd>` tag - keyboard tag

In CSS:
- `transition` and `transform` - allows to create animation

External source:
- (keycode.info)[keycode.info] - To get the key code from keyboard
